# Checkers - Project 1 - by Nick Duitsman

## Description
This is the classic game of Checkers. Players win by removing the opponents pieces. Pieces may only move diagonally, and can only make a jump if the piece they are jumping an opposing piece, NOT their own. Each player's piece may only move foward from their starting position until reaching their respective ends of the board; at this point the individual piece that reached the end becomes a king. King pieces may move forward or backward. So prioritize making those kings! 

In order to assist users, for those whom are unfamiliar with the rules, tiles will be highlighted indicating valid move locations.
